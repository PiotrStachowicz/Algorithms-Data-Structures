## Overview
This project includes several key algorithms and data structures commonly covered in computer science courses, focusing on topics such as sorting, tree structures, dynamic programming, and graph theory.
The implementations are designed to be efficient, showcasing optimized approaches to solving classical problems.

## Files
Below is a brief overview of the files and the problems they solve:

- **2SUM.cpp** & **3SUM.cpp**: Solutions for the classic 2SUM and 3SUM problems.
- **ClosestThreePoints.cpp** & **ClosestTwoPoints.cpp**: Algorithms to find the closest points on a plane.
- **Genealogy.cpp**: A solution for a genealogy problem involving family trees.
- **IDUL.cpp**: Implementation of the AVL Tree data structure.
- **Knapsack.cpp**: Solves the Unbounded Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
- **LCA.cpp**: Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm for trees.
- **LCIS.cpp** & **LCS.cpp**: Optimized algorithms for finding the Longest Common Increasing Subsequence and Longest Common Subsequence (with Hirschberg trick for O(n) space!!!).
- **Most_Disjoint_Segments.cpp**: Finds the maximum number of disjoint line segments.
- **Topology-Sort.cpp**: Implements topological sorting for acyclic directed graphs.
- **Trie-Tree.c**: A Trie data structure implementation.
- **bst.cpp**: Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation.
- **heap.cpp**: Min/Max Heap implementation.
- **LongestSubSeq.java**: Multi-threaded version of Longest subsequence (repeating) character problem
